# Pump_it_Up #

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we try to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which do not work at all. Predict of one of these three classes is based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. Ultimately, a smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

## Assignment Details ##

Your goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset. 

Label | Description
------------ | -------------
**functional** | the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
**non functional** | the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
**functional needs repair** | the waterpoint is not operational

The data comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.

In their own words:

> Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues. Think of it as a bug tracker for the real world which helps to engage citizens with their local government. We are currently working on an Innovation Project in Tanzania, with various partners.
